Team registration is done through the [website](https://finrl-contest-2023.web.app/). Please ensure that all team members input the same team leader. Registrations will be processed within 24 hours.

## Submission
All submissions are to be submitted through the website as well. Participants may choose to complete either or both tracks of the competition with no penalty. Note that the most recent submission that passes linting for each track will be the one used in final evaluations.
